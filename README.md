Hi, I’m @Dany3264, or just call me Dany.
I’m interested in start my career as a junior data analyst.
I’m currently learning better ways to plot and report, make it pretty!

I come from the fascinating world of professional kitchens, which had more in common with data science than i initially thought.From costs, ingredients, amounts, prices, rotation/
dates, and more, to a very fast-paced, hectic service throughout the mornings and nights. I started self-learning data science/ data analysis almost two years ago and slowly came/
to understand how businesses create significant changes with the power of data. I find it particularly fscinating how closely related it is to find meaningful insights int he analysis/
much like creating a new dish.

You bgin with a bunch of raw ingredients, then consider different factors such as weather, season, avaliabilty, people's sentiments, production costs, profit margins, production time and efficiency/
when it comes to serving during service, it's worth nothing if it's the most amazing dish in the world; guests must have their food perfectly done and served within 10-15 minutes.
Would you wait 1 hour and 40 minutes because we need to marinate each steak for an hour? I wouldn't either!.
After extensive testing and feedback from the team, we present a variety of ideas and solutions to the primary stakeholders (the owner or management team), guided by our executive and sous chefs team.
Can you see the resemblance?

During service, the line team must function like a well-oiled machine--organized, with constant communication, and, above everything, time management.
Being able to maintain your head, temper, and body working precisely despite workload is, I believe, the most valuable skill I've acquired in the service industry.
Besides interpersonal skills like effective problem-solving, mediation, and communication between departments are crucial to ensure a proper workflow.
The job can be as challenging as the mood of everyone involved, moral wins battles, divide and conquer.

I've been learning a variety of programs, libraries, methods and sets, it has been quite an adventure that's for sure.
I've learned Python and its main libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly. I found MySQL particularly interesting and how versatile it is to create, share, modify and use data.
All this may occasionally throw me off, like when I forgot the allowed substitute ratio in a recipe for a ingredient, or the temperature tolerance for a Beef Wellington/
a quick search for a solution, and some interest, usually does the trick.
